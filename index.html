<p>Advance Wars EX is an idea I thought up while playing Advance Wars 2 and Fire Emblem: Awakening. The goal was to take the Advance Wars formula and include some elements from the Fire Emblem series, such as having a set amount of units and unit advancement.</p>

<p>It is currently in development and is in a playable alpha state.</p>

<p>The alpha state (which is shown off below) currently consists of a 2-player 1v1 mode where the goal is to capture the enemy's HQ. Each side has only one available unit which is the Infantry and along the way to the enemy's base, they can capture cities and factories to allow them to produce more units closer to the front lines. If Infantry are successful in battle, then they will gain experience and soon be upgraded tot he Mech unit, who is capable of dealing more damage.</p>

<p>In the alpha, animations and music have not been implemented yet and there are a number of debug "cheats" on such as, enemies dying in one hit, 1 exp needed for upgrading a unit and buildings are captured immediately instead of over a number of turns.</p>

<p>Watch a demo of it:</p>
