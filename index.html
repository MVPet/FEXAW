        <p>This is a personal project I made to test out and become accustomed to the SFML API.</p>

<p>It is in an alpha state and was meant to be a learning tool than a large full fledged game.</p>

<p>The current state of the game has a 2-player 1v1 mode where the goal is to capture the enemy's HQ. Each side has only one available unit which is the Infantry and along the way to the enemy's base, they can capture cities and factories to allow them to produce more units closer to the front lines. If Infantry are successful in battle, then they will gain experience and soon be upgraded to the Mech unit, who is capable of dealing more damage.</p>
